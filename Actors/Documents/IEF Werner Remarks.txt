Some remarks for the IEFWerner:
-------------------------------
- Do not try to connect directly to the I/O variables from the OPC server. Instead duplicate them and link the new ones to the old ones.
- In the DSM, lower the OPC update rate from 1s to about 100ms (and also lower the reconnect poll rate if you want)
